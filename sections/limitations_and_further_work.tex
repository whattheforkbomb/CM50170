\section{Limitations and Further Work} % < 0.5 Pages
% What should be done to improve
Collect more data (to improve accuracy)

Collect the earbud data (if model unsuccessful)



% What were the limitations with the data collection / system developed?
Depending on the model limited by only recognising gestures, not pointing / cursor manipulation

Try transfer learning, had issues loading yunet as made for pytorch

% How would further research address these / build upon the current work
% Integrate into smartphone app, using MLKit from Google for landmark detection: https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/reference
