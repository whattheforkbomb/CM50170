\section{Limitations and Further Work} % < 0.5 Pages
% What should be done to improve
Collect more data (to improve accuracy)

Collect the earbud data (if model unsuccessful)

% Retrain with different hyper-params. Try additional facial landmarks (\cite{guobing2021headpose}, however requires face takes full image, can not also find face in image...)


% What were the limitations with the data collection / system developed?
Depending on the model limited by only recognising gestures, not pointing / cursor manipulation

% Try transfer learning, had issues loading yunet as made for pytorch

% How would further research address these / build upon the current work
% Integrate into smartphone app, using MLKit from Google for landmark detection: https://developers.google.com/ml-kit/reference
