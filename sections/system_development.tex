% \subsection{Design}
% App design (maybe some plant uml diagrams in appendix?)
% Produce either: regression model, able to predict orientation diff between face and phone (based on zeroed orientation); or classifier, able to predict the motion performed (e.g. head turn, phone moved, etc... without need for getting components of either) or to predict whether the observed head orientation is due to head or phone movement, then add some logic to determine which action given observed gesture + cause.
% need MoCap data to train regression model as need to know actual head orientation.
