\section{System Evaluation}
% How will be evaluated?
% Given the app, how will we evaluate it (setup tasks and verify success rate?)

\subsection{Results} % < 1 Page
% Raw results, table of stats, some analysis (e.g. success rate)


% No discussion or positing why results are what they are, just a table of data.

\subsection{Discussion} % < 1 Page
% Performance, how long to run models?
% How did models perform deployed compared to confusion matrices (did those with bad CM perform better than others?)
% NN Vs Other methods

% What do the results mean?
% Why might the cause of some of the issues be?
% Was this a success or failure?
