\section{Discussion} % < 1 Page
% How did models perform, what motions / gestures were difficult
% Which model performed best

% What do the results mean?
% Why might the cause of some of the issues be?
% Was this a success or failure?

% Performance, how long to run models?
% How did models perform deployed compared to confusion matrices (did those with bad CM perform better than others?)
% NN Vs Other methods


% What do the results mean?
% Why might the cause of some of the issues be?
% Was this a success or failure?


\subsection{Limitations and Further Work} % < 0.5 Pages
% What should be done to improve
% Collect more data (to improve accuracy)
% no images that do not contain a face (at least no labelled images as such. could use existing Android MLKit tools to cascade and ignore sequences over 20 frames without a head)
% only trained at 10fps, if gesture takes longer than 2 seconds, could fail to be accurately detected

% What were the limitations with the data collection / system developed?

% Retrain with different hyper-params ()


% Further work
Depending on the model limited by only recognising gestures, not pointing / cursor manipulation
% improve model for motion encoding, possibly utilise kalman filters, or an alternative preprocessing of the accelerations to help improve motion encoding for linear acceleration.

% Integrate into smartphone app and measure performance
